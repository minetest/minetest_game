# Minetest Game

[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/shields/title/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/)

Minetest Game (abbreviated MTG) is a simple and peaceful sandbox game, with no
real goals or built-in enemy mobs.

While it provides a basic gameplay experience out of the box, it is best played
with mods.

Minetest Game is in perpetual maintenance-only mode, meaning it will not see new
gameplay features or anything else that breaks compatibility (see
[#2710](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/issues/2710)).
