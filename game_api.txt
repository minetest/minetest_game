Minetest Game API
=================
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game


Introduction
------------

The Minetest Game game offers multiple new possibilities in addition to the Minetest engine's built-in API,
allowing you to add new plants to farming mod, buckets for new liquids, new stairs and custom panes.
For information on the Minetest API, visit https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/lua_api.txt
Please note:

 * [XYZ] refers to a section the Minetest API
 * [#ABC] refers to a section in this document
 * [pos] refers to a position table `{x = -5, y = 0, z = 200}`


Bucket API
----------

The bucket API allows registering new types of buckets for non-default liquids.

	bucket.register_liquid(
		"default:lava_source",   -- name of the source node
		"default:lava_flowing",  -- name of the flowing node
		"bucket:bucket_lava",    -- name of the new bucket item (or nil if liquid is not takeable)
		"bucket_lava.png",       -- texture of the new bucket item (ignored if itemname == nil)
		"Lava Bucket",           -- text description of the bucket item
		{lava_bucket = 1},       -- groups of the bucket item, OPTIONAL
		false                    -- force-renew, OPTIONAL. Force the liquid source to renew if it has
		                         -- a source neighbour, even if defined as 'liquid_renewable = false'.
		                         -- Needed to avoid creating holes in sloping rivers.
	)

The filled bucket item is returned to the player that uses an empty bucket pointing to the given liquid source.
When punching with an empty bucket pointing to an entity or a non-liquid node, the on_punch of the entity or node will be triggered.


Beds API
--------

	beds.register_bed(
		"beds:bed",    -- Bed name
		def            -- See [#Bed definition]
	)

 * `beds.can_dig(bed_pos)` Returns a boolean whether the bed at `bed_pos` may be dug
 * `beds.read_spawns() `   Returns a table containing players respawn positions
 * `beds.kick_players()`  Forces all players to leave bed
 * `beds.skip_night()`   Sets world time to morning and saves respawn position of all players currently sleeping
 * `beds.day_interval`   Is a table with keys "start" and "finish". Allows you
   to set the period of the day (timeofday format). Default: `{ start = 0.2, finish = 0.805 }`.

### Bed definition

	{
		description = "Simple Bed",
		inventory_image = "beds_bed.png",
		wield_image = "beds_bed.png",
		tiles = {
			bottom = {'Tile definition'}, -- the tiles of the bottom part of the bed.
			top = {Tile definition} -- the tiles of the bottom part of the bed.
		},
		nodebox = {
			bottom = 'regular nodebox',     -- bottom part of bed (see [Node boxes])
			top = 'regular nodebox',        -- top part of bed (see [Node boxes])
		},
		selectionbox = 'regular nodebox',  -- for both nodeboxes (see [Node boxes])
		recipe = {                                         -- Craft recipe
			{"group:wool", "group:wool", "group:wool"},
			{"group:wood", "group:wood", "group:wood"}
		}
	}


Bones API
---------

An ordered list of listnames (default: "main", "craft") of the player inventory,
that will be placed into bones or dropped on player death can be looked up or changed
in `bones.player_inventory_lists`.

e.g. `table.insert(bones.player_inventory_lists, "backpack")`


Creative API
------------

Use `creative.register_tab(name, title, items)` to add a tab with filtered items.
For example,

	creative.register_tab("tools", "Tools", minetest.registered_tools)

is used to show all tools. Name is used in the sfinv page name, title is the
human readable title.

Creative provides `creative.is_enabled_for(name)`, which is identical in
functionality to the engine's `minetest.creative_is_enabled(name)`.
Its use is deprecated and it should also not be overriden.

The contents of `creative.formspec_add` is appended to every creative inventory
page. Mods can use it to add additional formspec elements onto the default
creative inventory formspec to be drawn after each update.

Group overrides can be used for any registered item, node or tool. Use one of
the groups stated below to pick which category it will appear in.

	node = 1      -- Appears in the Nodes category
	tool = 1      -- Appears in the Tools category
	craftitem = 1 -- Appears in the Items category


Chests API
----------

The chests API allows the creation of chests, which have their own inventories for holding items.

`default.chest.get_chest_formspec(pos)`

 * Returns a formspec for a specific chest.
 * `pos` Location of the chest node, e.g `{x = 1, y = 1, z = 1}`

`default.chest.chest_lid_obstructed(pos)`

 * Returns a boolean depending on whether or not a chest has its top obstructed by a solid node.
 * `pos` Location of the chest node, e.g `{x = 1, y = 1, z = 1}`

`default.chest.chest_lid_close(pn)`

 * Closes the chest that a player is currently looking in.
 * `pn` The name of the player whose chest is going to be closed

`default.chest.open_chests`

 * A table indexed by player name to keep track of who opened what chest.
 * Key: The name of the player.
 * Value: A table containing information about the chest the player is looking at.
   e.g `{ pos = {1, 1, 1}, sound = null, swap = "default:chest" }`

`default.chest.register_chest(name, def)`

 * Registers new chest
 * `name` Name for chest e.g. "default:chest"
 * `def`  See [#Chest Definition]

	sound_open = "default_chest_open",
	sound_close = "default_chest_close",
	groups = {choppy = 2, oddly_breakable_by_hand = 2},
	protected = false, -- If true, only placer can modify chest.


Doors API
---------

The doors mod allows modders to register custom doors and trapdoors.

`doors.registered_doors[name] = Door definition` 
 * Table of registered doors, indexed by door name 

`doors.registered_trapdoors[name] = Trapdoor definition` 
 * Table of registered trap doors, indexed by trap door name 

`doors.register_door(name, def)`

 * Registers new door
 * `name` Name for door
 * `def`  See [#Door definition]

`doors.register_trapdoor(name, def)`

 * `def`  See [#Trapdoor definition]

`doors.register_fencegate(name, def)`

 * Registers new fence gate
 * `name` Name for fence gate
 * `def`  See [#Fence gate definition]

`doors.get(pos)`

 * `pos` A position as a table, e.g `{x = 1, y = 1, z = 1}`
 * Returns an ObjectRef to a door, or nil if the position does not contain a door

    ### Methods

        :open(player)   -- Open the door object, returns if door was opened
        :close(player)  -- Close the door object, returns if door was closed
        :toggle(player) -- Toggle the door state, returns if state was toggled
        :state()        -- returns the door state, true = open, false = closed

    the "player" parameter can be omitted in all methods. If passed then
    the usual permission checks will be performed to make sure the player
    has the permissions needed to open this door. If omitted then no
    permission checks are performed.

`doors.door_toggle(pos, node, clicker)`

 * Toggle door open or shut
 * `pos` Position of the door
 * `node` Node definition
 * `clicker` Player definition for the player that clicked on the door

Fence API
---------

Allows creation of new fences with "fencelike" drawtype.

`default.register_fence(name, item definition)`

Add it to an item to make it burn up when dropped in lava or fire.
New node def property:

`on_burn(pos)`

 * Called when fire attempts to remove a burning node.
 * `pos` Position of the burning node.

 `on_ignite(pos, igniter)`

Give Initial Stuff API
----------------------

`give_initial_stuff.give(player)`

Player API
----------

The player API can register player models and update the player's appearance.

* `player_api.globalstep(dtime, ...)`
	* The function called by the globalstep that controls player animations.
	  You can override this to replace the globalstep with your own implementation.
	* Receives all args that minetest.register_globalstep() passes

* `player_api.register_model(name, def)`
	* Register a new model to be used by players
	* `name`: model filename such as "character.x", "foo.b3d", etc.
	* `def`: see [#Model definition]
	* Saved to player_api.registered_models

* `player_api.registered_models[name]`
	* Get a model's definition
	* `name`: model filename
	* See [#Model definition]

* `player_api.set_model(player, model_name)`
	* Change a player's model
	* `player`: PlayerRef
	* `model_name`: model registered with `player_api.register_model`

* `player_api.set_animation(player, anim_name, speed)`
	* Applies an animation to a player if speed or anim_name differ from the currently playing animation

	* Any of the fields of the returned table may be nil
	* `player`: PlayerRef

* `player_api.player_attached`
	* A table that maps a player name to a boolean
	* If the value for a given player is set to true, the default player animations
	  (walking, digging, ...) will no longer be updated, and knockback from damage is
	  prevented for that player
	* Example of usage: A mod sets a player's value to true when attached to a vehicle

### Model Definition

	{
		animation_speed = 30,           -- Default animation speed, in keyframes per second
		textures = {"character.png"},   -- Default array of textures
		animations = {
			-- [anim_name] = {
			--   x = <start_frame>,
			--   y = <end_frame>,
			--   collisionbox = <model collisionbox>, -- (optional)
			--   eye_height = <model eye height>,     -- (optional)
			--   -- suspend client side animations while this one is active (optional)
			--   override_local = <true/false>
			-- },
			stand = ..., lay = ..., walk = ..., mine = ..., walk_mine = ..., -- required animations
			sit = ... -- used by boats and other MTG mods
		},
		-- Default object properties, see lua_api.txt
		visual_size = {x = 1, y = 1},
		collisionbox = {-0.3, 0.0, -0.3, 0.3, 1.7, 0.3},
		stepheight = 0.6,
		eye_height = 1.47
	}


TNT API
-------

`tnt.register_tnt(definition)`

^ Register a new type of tnt.

 * `name` The name of the node. If no prefix is given `tnt` is used.
 * `description` A description for your TNT.
 * `radius` The radius within which the TNT can destroy nodes. The default is 3.
 * `damage_radius` The radius within which the TNT can damage players and mobs. By default it is twice the `radius`.
 * `sound` The sound played when explosion occurs. By default it is `tnt_explode`.
 * `disable_drops` Disable drops. By default it is set to false.
 * `ignore_protection` Don't check `minetest.is_protected` before removing a node.
 * `ignore_on_blast` Don't call `on_blast` even if a node has one.
 * `tiles` Textures for node
  * `side`  Side tiles. By default the name of the tnt with a suffix of `_side.png`.
  * `top`  Top tile. By default the name of the tnt with a suffix of `_top.png`.
  * `bottom` Bottom tile. By default the name of the tnt with a suffix of `_bottom.png`.
  * `burning` Top tile when lit. By default the name of the tnt with a suffix of `_top_burning_animated.png".

`tnt.boom(position[, definition])`

^ Create an explosion.

* `position` The center of explosion.
* `definition` The TNT definion as passed to `tnt.register` with the following addition:
 * `explode_center` false by default which removes TNT node on blast, when true will explode center node.

`tnt.burn(position, [nodename])`

^ Ignite node at position, triggering its `on_ignite` callback (see fire mod).
If no such callback exists, fallback to turn tnt group nodes to their
"_burning" variant.
  nodename isn't required unless already known.

To make dropping items from node inventories easier, you can use the
following helper function from 'default':

default.get_inventory_drops(pos, inventory, drops)

^ Return drops from node inventory "inventory" in drops.

* `pos` - the node position
* `inventory` - the name of the inventory (string)
* `drops` - an initialized list

The function returns no values. The drops are returned in the `drops`
parameter, and drops is not reinitialized so you can call it several
times in a row to add more inventory items to it.


`on_blast` callbacks:

Both nodedefs and entitydefs can provide an `on_blast()` callback

`nodedef.on_blast(pos, intensity)`
^ Allow drop and node removal overriding
* `pos` - node position
* `intensity` - TNT explosion measure. larger or equal to 1.0
^ Should return a list of drops (e.g. {"default:stone"})
^ Should perform node removal itself. If callback exists in the nodedef
^ then the TNT code will not destroy this node.

`entitydef.on_blast(luaobj, damage)`
^ Allow TNT effects on entities to be overridden
* `luaobj` - LuaEntityRef of the entity
* `damage` - suggested HP damage value
^ Should return a list of (bool do_damage, bool do_knockback, table drops)
* `do_damage` - if true then TNT mod wil damage the entity
* `do_knockback` - if true then TNT mod will knock the entity away
* `drops` - a list of drops, e.g. {"wool:red"}


Screwdriver API
---------------

The screwdriver API allows you to control a node's behaviour when a screwdriver is used on it.
To use it, add the `on_screwdriver` function to the node definition.

`on_rotate(pos, node, user, mode, new_param2)`

 * `pos` Position of the node that the screwdriver is being used on
 * `node` that node
 * `user` The player who used the screwdriver
 * `mode` screwdriver.ROTATE_FACE or screwdriver.ROTATE_AXIS
 * `new_param2` the new value of param2 that would have been set if on_rotate wasn't there
 * return value: false to disallow rotation, nil to keep default behaviour, true to allow
 	it but to indicate that changed have already been made (so the screwdriver will wear out)
 * use `on_rotate = false` to always disallow rotation
 * use `on_rotate = screwdriver.rotate_simple` to allow only face rotation


Sethome API
-----------

The sethome API adds three global functions to allow mods to read a players home position,
set a players home position and teleport a player to home position.

`sethome.get(name)`

 * `name` Player who's home position you wish to get
 * return value: false if no player home coords exist, position table if true

`sethome.set(name, pos)`

 * `name` Player who's home position you wish to set
 * `pos` Position table containing coords of home position
 * return value: false if unable to set and save new home position, otherwise true

`sethome.go(name)`

 * `name` Player you wish to teleport to their home position
 * return value: false if player cannot be sent home, otherwise true


Sfinv API
---------

It is recommended that you read this link for a good introduction to the

* sfinv.register_page(name, def) - register a page, see section below
* sfinv.override_page(name, def) - overrides fields of an page registered with register_page.
    * Note: Page must already be defined, (opt)depend on the mod defining it.
* sfinv.set_player_inventory_formspec(player) - (re)builds page formspec
             and calls set_inventory_formspec().
* sfinv.get_formspec(player, context) - builds current page's formspec

**Contexts**

* sfinv.get_or_create_context(player) - gets the player's context

    * size, defaults to `size[8,8.6]` if not specified
* sfinv.get_nav_fs(player, context, nav, current_idx) - creates tabheader or ""

### sfinv Members

* pages - table of pages[pagename] = def
* pages_unordered - array table of pages in order of addition (used to build navigation tabs).

Use sfinv.make_formspec to apply a layout:

	return sfinv.make_formspec(player, context, [[
		list[current_player;craft;1.75,0.5;3,3;]
		list[current_player;craftpreview;5.75,1.5;1,1;]
		image[4.75,1.5;1,1;gui_furnace_arrow_bg.png^[transformR270]
		listring[current_player;main]
		listring[current_player;craft]
		image[0,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
		image[1,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
		image[2,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
		image[3,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
		image[4,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
		image[5,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
		image[6,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
		image[7,4.25;1,1;gui_hb_bg.png]
	]], true)

See above (methods section) for more options.

### Customising themes

Simply override this function to change the navigation:

	function sfinv.get_nav_fs(player, context, nav, current_idx)
		return "navformspec"
	end

And override this function to change the layout:

	function sfinv.make_formspec(player, context, content, show_inv, size)
		local tmp = {
			size or "size[8,8.6]",
			theme_main,
			sfinv.get_nav_fs(player, context, context.nav_titles, context.nav_idx),
			content
		}
		if show_inv then
			tmp[4] = theme_inv
		end
		return table.concat(tmp, "")
	end


Stairs API
----------

The stairs API lets you register stairs and slabs and ensures that they are registered the same way as those
delivered with Minetest Game, to keep them compatible with other mods.

The following node attributes are sourced from the recipeitem:
 * use_texture_alpha
 * sunlight_propagates
 * light_source
 * If the recipeitem is a fuel, the stair/slab is also registered as a fuel of proportionate burntime.

`stairs.register_stair(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds, worldaligntex)`

 * Registers a stair
 * `subname`: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_subname"
 * `recipeitem`: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble", may be `nil`
 * `groups`: See [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 * `images`: See [Tile definition]
 * `description`: Used for the description field in the stair's definition
 * `sounds`: See [#Default sounds]
 * `worldaligntex`: A bool to set all textures world-aligned. Default false. See [Tile definition]

`stairs.register_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds, worldaligntex)`

 * Registers a slab
 * `subname`: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the slab name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:slab_subname"
 * `recipeitem`: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble"
 * `groups`: See [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 * `images`: See [Tile definition]
 * `description`: Used for the description field in the slab's definition
 * `sounds`: See [#Default sounds]
 * `worldaligntex`: A bool to set all textures world-aligned. Default false. See [Tile definition]

`stairs.register_stair_inner(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds, worldaligntex, full_description)`

 * Registers an inner corner stair
 * `subname`: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_inner_subname"
 * `recipeitem`: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble", may be `nil`
 * `groups`: See [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 * `images`: See [Tile definition]
 * `description`: Used for the description field in the stair's definition with "Inner" prepended
 * `sounds`: See [#Default sounds]
 * `worldaligntex`: A bool to set all textures world-aligned. Default false. See [Tile definition]
 * `full_description`: Overrides the description, bypassing string concatenation. This is useful for translation. (optional)

`stairs.register_stair_outer(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds, worldaligntex, full_description)`

 * Registers an outer corner stair
 * `subname`: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_outer_subname"
 * `recipeitem`: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble", may be `nil`
 * `groups`: See [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 * `images`: See [Tile definition]
 * `description`: Used for the description field in the stair's definition with "Outer" prepended
 * `sounds`: See [#Default sounds]
 * `worldaligntex`: A bool to set all textures world-aligned. Default false. See [Tile definition]
 * `full_description`: Overrides the description, bypassing string concatenation. This is useful for translation. (optional)

```
stairs.register_stair_and_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, desc_stair, desc_slab,
	sounds, worldaligntex, desc_stair_inner, desc_stair_outer)
```

 * A wrapper for stairs.register_stair, stairs.register_slab, stairs.register_stair_inner, stairs.register_stair_outer
 * Uses almost the same arguments as stairs.register_stair
 * `desc_stair`: Description for stair nodes. For corner stairs 'Inner' or 'Outer' will be prefixed unless
 	`desc_stair_inner` or `desc_stair_outer` are specified, which are used instead.
 * `desc_slab`: Description for slab node
 * `desc_stair_inner`: Description for inner stair node
 * `desc_stair_outer`: Description for outer stair node


Xpanes API
----------

Creates panes that automatically connect to each other

`xpanes.register_pane(subname, def)`

 * `subname`: used for nodename. Result: "xpanes:subname" and "xpanes:subname_{2..15}"
 * `def`: See [#Pane definition]

### Pane definition

	{
		textures = {
			"texture for front and back",
			(unused),
			"texture for the 4 edges"
		}, -- More tiles aren't supported
		groups = {group = rating}, -- Uses the known node groups, see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
		sounds = SoundSpec,        -- See [#Default sounds]
		recipe = {{"","","","","","","","",""}}, -- Recipe field only
		use_texture_alpha = true, -- Optional boolean (default: `false`) for colored glass panes
	}


Raillike definitions
--------------------

The following nodes use the group `connect_to_raillike` and will only connect to
raillike nodes within this group and the same group value.
Use `minetest.raillike_group(<Name>)` to get the group value.

| Node type             | Raillike group name
|-----------------------|---------------------
| default:rail          | "rail"
| tnt:gunpowder         | "gunpowder"
| tnt:gunpowder_burning	| "gunpowder"

Example:
If you want to add a new rail type and want it to connect with default:rail,
add `connect_to_raillike=minetest.raillike_group("rail")` into the `groups` table
of your node.


Default sounds
--------------

Sounds inside the default table can be used within the sounds field of node definitions.

 * `default.node_sound_defaults()`
 * `default.node_sound_stone_defaults()`
 * `default.node_sound_dirt_defaults()`
 * `default.node_sound_sand_defaults()`
 * `default.node_sound_wood_defaults()`
 * `default.node_sound_leaves_defaults()`
 * `default.node_sound_glass_defaults()`
 * `default.node_sound_metal_defaults()`


Default constants
-----------------

`default.LIGHT_MAX`  The maximum light level (see [Node definition] light_source)


GUI and formspecs
-----------------

`default.get_hotbar_bg(x, y)`

 * Get the hotbar background as string, containing the formspec elements
 * x: Horizontal position in the formspec
 * y: Vertical position in the formspec

`default.gui_bg`

 * Deprecated, remove from mods.

`default.gui_bg_img`

 * Deprecated, remove from mods.

`default.gui_slots`

 * Deprecated, remove from mods.

`default.gui_survival_form`

 * Entire formspec for the survival inventory

`default.get_furnace_active_formspec(fuel_percent, item_percent)`

 * Get the active furnace formspec using the defined GUI elements
 * fuel_percent: Percent of how much the fuel is used
 * item_percent: Percent of how much the item is cooked

`default.get_furnace_inactive_formspec()`

 * Get the inactive furnace formspec using the defined GUI elements


Leafdecay
---------

To enable leaf decay for leaves when a tree is cut down by a player,
register the tree with the default.register_leafdecay(leafdecaydef)
function.

If `param2` of any registered node is ~= 0, the node will always be
preserved. Thus, if the player places a node of that kind, you will
want to set `param2 = 1` or so.

The function `default.after_place_leaves` can be set as
`after_place_node of a node` to set param2 to 1 if the player places
the node (should not be used for nodes that use param2 otherwise
(e.g. facedir)).

If the node is in the `leafdecay_drop` group then it will always be
dropped as an item.

`default.register_leafdecay(leafdecaydef)`

`leafdecaydef` is a table, with following members:
	{
		trunks = {"default:tree"}, -- nodes considered trunks
		leaves = {"default:leaves", "default:apple"},
			-- nodes considered for removal
		radius = 3, -- radius to consider for searching
	}

Note: all the listed nodes in `trunks` have their `on_after_destruct`
callback overridden. All the nodes listed in `leaves` have their
`on_timer` callback overridden.


Dyes
----

Minetest Game dyes are registered with:

    groups = {dye = 1, color_<color> = 1},

To make recipes that will work with dyes from many mods, define them using the
dye group and the color groups.

Dye color groups:

 * `color_white`
 * `color_grey`
 * `color_dark_grey`
 * `color_black`
 * `color_red`
 * `color_pink`
 * `color_orange`
 * `color_brown`
 * `color_yellow`
 * `color_green`
 * `color_dark_green`
 * `color_blue`
 * `color_cyan`
 * `color_violet`
 * `color_magenta`

Example of one shapeless recipe using the dye group and a color group:

	minetest.register_craft({
		type = "shapeless",
		output = "<mod>:item_yellow",
		recipe = {"<mod>:item_no_color", "group:dye,color_yellow"},
	})


Trees
-----

 * `default.grow_tree(pos, is_apple_tree)`
  * Grows a mgv6 tree or apple tree at pos

 * `default.grow_jungle_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a mgv6 jungletree at pos

 * `default.grow_pine_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a mgv6 pinetree at pos

 * `default.grow_new_apple_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a new design apple tree at pos

 * `default.grow_new_jungle_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a new design jungle tree at pos

 * `default.grow_new_pine_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a new design pine tree at pos

 * `default.grow_new_snowy_pine_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a new design snowy pine tree at pos

 * `default.grow_new_acacia_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a new design acacia tree at pos

 * `default.grow_new_aspen_tree(pos)`
  * Grows a new design aspen tree at pos

 * `default.grow_bush(pos)`
  * Grows a bush at pos

 * `default.grow_acacia_bush(pos)`
  * Grows an acaia bush at pos

 * `default.grow_pine_bush(pos)`
  * Grows a pine bush at pos

 * `default.grow_blueberry_bush(pos)`
  * Grows a blueberry bush at pos


Carts
-----

	carts.register_rail(
		"mycarts:myrail", -- Rail name
		nodedef,          -- standard nodedef
		railparams        -- rail parameter struct (optional)
	)

	railparams = {
		on_step(obj, dtime), -- Event handler called when
		                     -- cart is on rail
		acceleration, -- integer acceleration factor (negative
		              -- values to brake)
	}

	The event handler is called after all default calculations
	are made, so the custom on_step handler can override things
	like speed, acceleration, player attachment. The handler will
	likely be called many times per second, so the function needs
	to make sure that the event is handled properly.


Key API
-------

The key API allows mods to add key functionality to nodes that have
ownership or specific permissions. Using the API will make it so
that a node owner can use skeleton keys on their nodes to create keys
for that node in that location, and give that key to other players,
allowing them some sort of access that they otherwise would not have
due to node protection.

To make your new nodes work with the key API, you need to register
two callback functions in each nodedef:


`on_key_use(pos, player)`
 * Is called when a player right-clicks (uses) a normal key on your
 * node.
 * `pos` - position of the node
 * `player` - PlayerRef
 * return value: none, ignored

The `on_key_use` callback should validate that the player is wielding
a key item with the right key meta secret. If needed the code should
deny access to the node functionality.

If formspecs are used, the formspec callbacks should duplicate these
checks in the metadata callback functions.


`on_skeleton_key_use(pos, player, newsecret)`

 * Is called when a player right-clicks (uses) a skeleton key on your
 * node.
 * `pos` - position of the node
 * `player` - PlayerRef
 * `newsecret` - a secret value(string)
 * return values:
 * `secret` - `nil` or the secret value that unlocks the door
 * `name` - a string description of the node ("a locked chest")
 * `owner` - name of the node owner

The `on_skeleton_key_use` function should validate that the player has
the right permissions to make a new key for the item. The newsecret
value is useful if the node has no secret value. The function should
store this secret value somewhere so that in the future it may compare
key secrets and match them to allow access. If a node already has a
secret value, the function should return that secret value instead
of the newsecret value. The secret value stored for the node should
not be overwritten, as this would invalidate existing keys.

Aside from the secret value, the function should retun a descriptive
name for the node and the owner name. The return values are all
encoded in the key that will be given to the player in replacement
for the wielded skeleton key.

if `nil` is returned, it is assumed that the wielder did not have
permissions to create a key for this node, and no key is created.

`default.register_craft_metadata_copy(ingredient, result)`
----------------------------------------------------------

This function registers a shapeless recipe that takes `ingredient`
and `result` as input and outputs `result`.

The metadata of the input `result` is copied to the output `result`.


Log API
-------

Logs action of the player with a node at a certain position.
By default only actions of real players are logged.
Actions of non-players (usually machines) are logged only when
setting `log_non_player_actions` is enabled.
A player is considered non-player if `player:is_player()` returns
`false` or `player.is_fake_player` is truthy. The use of
`is_fake_player` is an unofficial standard between mods.
These non-players are marked by the content of `is_fake_player`
(if it is a string) or a "*" in brackets after the player name in
the log.

`default.log_player_action(player, ...)`

 * `player`        The player who performed the action
 * `message_parts` Any mumber of message parts describing the action
                   in 3rd person singular present tense. It can also
                   contain a `pos` which is logged as "(X,Y,Z)"

`default.set_inventory_action_loggers(def, name)`

 * sets the callbacks `on_metadata_inventory_move`,
   `on_metadata_inventory_put` and `on_metadata_inventory_take`
   that log corresponding actions
 * `def`     See [Node definition]
 * `name`    Description of the node in the log message
