Minetest Game API
=================
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game

Introduction
------------
The Minetest Game subgame offers multiple new possibilities in addition to the Minetest engine's built-in API,
allowing you to add new plants to farming mod, buckets for new liquids, new stairs and custom panes.
For information on the Minetest API, visit https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/lua_api.txt
Please note:
	[XYZ] refers to a section the Minetest API
	[#ABC] refers to a section in this document
	^ Explanation for line above

Bucket API
----------
The bucket API allows registering new types of buckets for non-default liquids.

	bucket.register_liquid(
		"default:lava_source",   -- name of the source node
		"default:lava_flowing",  -- name of the flowing node
		"bucket:bucket_lava",    -- name of the new bucket item (or nil if liquid is not takeable)
		"bucket_lava.png",       -- texture of the new bucket item (ignored if itemname == nil)
		"Lava Bucket",           -- text description of the bucket item
		{lava_bucket = 1}        -- groups of the bucket item, OPTIONAL
	)

Beds API
--------
	beds.register_bed(
		"beds:bed",                 -- Bed name
		def: See [#Bed definition]  -- Bed definition
	)

	beds.read_spawns()   -- returns a table containing players respawn positions
	beds.kick_players()  -- forces all players to leave bed
	beds.skip_night()    -- sets world time to morning and saves respawn position of all players currently sleeping

#Bed definition
---------------
{
	description = "Simple Bed",
	inventory_image = "beds_bed.png",
	wield_image = "beds_bed.png",
	tiles = {
	    bottom = {[Tile definition],
		^ the tiles of the bottom part of the bed
	    },
	    top = {[Tile definition],
		^ the tiles of the bottom part of the bed
	    }
	},
	nodebox = {
	    bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes],    -- bottm part of bed
	    top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes],       -- top part of bed
	},
	selectionbox = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes],  -- for both nodeboxes
	recipe = {                                         -- Craft recipe
		{"group:wool", "group:wool", "group:wool"},
		{"group:wood", "group:wood", "group:wood"}
	}
}

Doors API
---------
The doors mod allows modders to register custom doors and trapdoors.

doors.register_door(name, def)
^ name: "Door name"
^ def: See [#Door definition]
 -> Registers new door

doors.register_trapdoor(name, def)
^ name: "Trapdoor name"
^ def: See [#Trapdoor definition]
 -> Registers new trapdoor

#Door definition
----------------
{
	description = "Door description",
	inventory_image = "mod_door_inv.png",
	groups = {group = 1},
	tiles_bottom: [Tile definition],
	^ the tiles of the bottom part of the door {front, side}
	tiles_top: [Tile definition],
	^ the tiles of the bottom part of the door {front, side}
	node_box_bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	node_box_top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	sound_open_door = sound play for open door, OPTIONAL,
	sound_close_door = sound play for close door, OPTIONAL,
	only_placer_can_open = true/false,
	^ If true, only placer can open the door (locked for others)
}

#Trapdoor definition
----------------
{
	tile_front = "doors_trapdoor.png",
	^ the texture for the front and back of the trapdoor
	tile_side: "doors_trapdoor_side.png",
	^ the tiles of the four side parts of the trapdoor
	sound_open = sound to play when opening the trapdoor, OPTIONAL,
	sound_close = sound to play when closing the trapdoor, OPTIONAL,
	-> You can add any other node definition properties for minetest.register_node,
		such as wield_image, inventory_image, sounds, groups, description, ...
		Only node_box, selection_box, tiles, drop, drawtype, paramtype, paramtype2, on_rightclick
		will be overwritten by the trapdoor registration function
}

Fence API
---------
Allows creation of new fences with "fencelike" drawtype.

default.register_fence(name, item definition)
 ^ Registers a new fence. Custom fields texture and material are required, as
 ^ are name and description. The rest is optional. You can pass most normal
 ^ nodedef fields here except drawtype. The fence group will always be added
 ^ for this node.

#fence definition
	name = "default:fence_wood",
	description = "Wooden Fence",
	texture = "default_wood.png",
	material = "default:wood",
	groups = {choppy=2, oddly_breakable_by_hand = 2, flammable = 2},
	sounds = default.node_sound_wood_defaults(),

Farming API
-----------
The farming API allows you to easily register plants and hoes.

farming.register_hoe(name, hoe definition)
 -> Register a new hoe, see [#hoe definition]

farming.register_plant(name, Plant definition)
 -> Register a new growing plant, see [#Plant definition]

#Hoe Definition
---------------
{
	description = "",                      -- Description for tooltip
	inventory_image = ,                    -- Image to be used as wield- and inventory image
	max_uses = 30,                         -- Uses until destroyed
	material = "",                         -- Material for recipes
	recipe = ,                             -- Craft recipe, if material isn't used
}

#Plant definition
-----------------
{
	description = "",                      -- Description of seed item
	inventory_image = ,                    -- Image to be used as seed's wield- and inventory image
	steps = 8,                             -- How many steps the plant has to grow, until it can be harvested
	^ Always provide a plant texture for each step, format: modname_plantname_i.png (i = stepnumber)
	minlight = 13,                         -- Minimum light to grow
	maxlight = default.LIGHT_MAX           -- Maximum light to grow
}

Screwdriver API
---------------
The screwdriver API allows you to control a node's behaviour when a screwdriver is used on it.
To use it, add the on_screwdriver function to the node definition.
on_rotate(pos, node, user, mode, new_param2)
^ pos: position of the node that the screwdriver is being used on
^ node: that node
^ user: the player who used the screwdriver
^ mode: screwdriver.ROTATE_FACE or screwdriver.ROTATE_AXIS
^ new_param2: the new value of param2 that would have been set if on_rotate wasn't there
^ return value: false to disallow rotation, nil to keep default behaviour, true to allow
 	it but to indicate that changed have already been made (so the screwdriver will wear out)
^ use on_rotate = screwdriver.disallow to always disallow rotation
^ use on_rotate = screwdriver.rotate_simple to allow only face rotation

Stairs API
----------
The stairs API lets you register stairs and slabs and ensures that they are registered the same way as those
delivered with Minetest Game, to keep them compatible with other mods.

stairs.register_stair(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds)
 -> Registers a stair.
 -> subname: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_subname"
 -> recipeitem: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble"
 -> groups: see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 -> images: see [Tile definition]
 -> description: used for the description field in the stair's definition
 -> sounds: see [#Default sounds]

stairs.register_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds)
 -> Registers a slabs
 -> subname: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_subname"
 -> recipeitem: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble"
 -> groups: see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 -> images: see [Tile definition]
 -> description: used for the description field in the stair's definition
 -> sounds: see [#Default sounds]

stairs.register_stair_and_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, desc_stair, desc_slab, sounds)
 -> A wrapper for stairs.register_stair and stairs.register_slab
 -> Uses almost the same arguments as stairs.register_stair
 -> desc_stair: Description for stair node
 -> desc_slab: Description for slab node

Xpanes API
----------
Creates panes that automatically connect to each other

xpanes.register_pane(subname, def)
 -> subname: used for nodename. Result: "xpanes:subname" and "xpanes:subname_{2..15}"
 -> def: See [#Pane definition]

#Pane definition
----------------
{
	textures = {"texture_Bottom_top", "texture_left_right", "texture_front_back"},
	^ More tiles aren't supported
	groups = {group = rating},
	^ Uses the known node groups, see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
	sounds = SoundSpec,
	^ See [#Default sounds]
	recipe = {{"","","","","","","","",""}},
	^ Recipe field only
}

Raillike definitions
--------------------
The following nodes use the group `connect_to_raillike` and will only connect to
raillike nodes within this group and the same group value.
Use `minetest.raillike_group(<Name>)` to get the group value.

| Node type             | Raillike group name
+-----------------------+--------------------
| default:rail          | "rail"
| tnt:gunpowder         | "gunpowder"
| tnt:gunpowder_burning	| "gunpowder"

Example:
If you want to add a new rail type and want it to connect with default:rail,
add `connect_to_raillike=minetest.raillike_group("rail")` into the `groups` table
of your node.


Default sounds
--------------
Sounds inside the default table can be used within the sounds field of node definitions.

default.node_sound_defaults()
default.node_sound_stone_defaults()
default.node_sound_dirt_defaults()
default.node_sound_sand_defaults()
default.node_sound_wood_defaults()
default.node_sound_leaves_defaults()
default.node_sound_glass_defaults()

Default constants
-----------------
default.LIGHT_MAX
^ The maximum light level (see [Node definition] light_source)

Player API
----------
The player API can register player models and update the player's appearence

default.player_register_model(name, def)
^ Register a new model to be used by players.
 -> name: model filename such as "character.x", "foo.b3d", etc.
 -> def: See [#Model definition]

default.registered_player_models[name]
^ Get a model's definition
 -> see [#Model definition]

default.player_set_model(player, model_name)
^ Change a player's model
 -> player: PlayerRef
 -> model_name: model registered with player_register_model()

default.player_set_animation(player, anim_name [, speed])
^ Applies an animation to a player
 -> anim_name: name of the animation.
 -> speed: frames per second. If nil, default from the model is used

default.player_set_textures(player, textures)
^ Sets player textures
 -> player: PlayerRef
 -> textures: array of textures
 ^ If <textures> is nil, the default textures from the model def are used

default.player_get_animation(player)
^ Returns a table containing fields "model", "textures" and "animation".
^ Any of the fields of the returned table may be nil.
 -> player: PlayerRef

Model Definition
----------------
{
	animation_speed = 30,            -- Default animation speed, in FPS.
	textures = {"character.png", },  -- Default array of textures.
	visual_size = {x = 1, y = 1},    -- Used to scale the model.
	animations = {
		-- <anim_name> = {x = <start_frame>, y = <end_frame>},
		foo = {x = 0, y = 19},
		bar = {x = 20, y = 39},
		-- ...
	},
}

Leafdecay
---------
To enable leaf decay for a node, add it to the "leafdecay" group.

The rating of the group determines how far from a node in the group "tree"
the node can be without decaying.

If param2 of the node is ~= 0, the node will always be preserved. Thus, if
the player places a node of that kind, you will want to set param2=1 or so.

The function default.after_place_leaves can be set as after_place_node of a node
to set param2 to 1 if the player places the node (should not be used for nodes
that use param2 otherwise (e.g. facedir)).

If the node is in the leafdecay_drop group then it will always be dropped as an
item.

Dyes
----
To make recipes that will work with any dye ever made by anybody, define
them based on groups. You can select any group of groups, based on your need for
amount of colors.

#Color groups
-------------
Base color groups:
- basecolor_white
- basecolor_grey
- basecolor_black
- basecolor_red
- basecolor_yellow
- basecolor_green
- basecolor_cyan
- basecolor_blue
- basecolor_magenta

Extended color groups (* = equal to a base color):
* excolor_white
- excolor_lightgrey
* excolor_grey
- excolor_darkgrey
* excolor_black
* excolor_red
- excolor_orange
* excolor_yellow
- excolor_lime
* excolor_green
- excolor_aqua
* excolor_cyan
- excolor_sky_blue
* excolor_blue
- excolor_violet
* excolor_magenta
- excolor_red_violet

The whole unifieddyes palette as groups:
- unicolor_<excolor>
For the following, no white/grey/black is allowed:
- unicolor_medium_<excolor>
- unicolor_dark_<excolor>
- unicolor_light_<excolor>
- unicolor_<excolor>_s50
- unicolor_medium_<excolor>_s50
- unicolor_dark_<excolor>_s50

Example of one shapeless recipe using a color group:
minetest.register_craft({
	type = "shapeless",
	output = '<mod>:item_yellow',
	recipe = {'<mod>:item_no_color', 'group:basecolor_yellow'},
})
