minetest_game API
======================
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game

Introduction
------------
The minetest_game gamemode offers multiple new possibilities in addition to Minetest's built-in API, allowing you to
add new plants to farming mod, buckets for new liquids, new stairs and custom panes.
For information on the Minetest API, visit https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/lua_api.txt
Please note:
	[XYZ] refers to a section the Minetest API
	[#ABC] refers to a section in this document
	^ Explanation for line above

Bucket API
----------
The bucket API allows registering new types of buckets for non-default liquids.

	bucket.register_liquid(
		"default:lava_source",		-- Source node name
		"default:lava_flowing",		-- Flowing node name
		"bucket:bucket_lava",		-- Name to be used for bucket
		"bucket_lava.png",			-- Bucket texture (for wielditem and inventory_image)
		"Lava Bucket"				-- Bucket description
	)

Doors API
---------
The doors mod allows modders to register custom doors and trapdoors.

doors.register_door(name, def)
^ name: "Door name"
^ def: See [#Door definition]
 -> Registers new door

doors.register_trapdoor(name, def)
^ name: "Trapdoor name"
^ def: See [#Trapdoor definition]
 -> Registers new trapdoor

#Door definition
----------------
{
	description = "Door description",
	inventory_image = "mod_door_inv.png",
	groups = {group = 1},
	tiles_bottom: [Tile definition],
	^ the tiles of the bottom part of the door {front, side}
	tiles_top: [Tile definition],
	^ the tiles of the bottom part of the door {front, side}
	node_box_bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	node_box_top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	sound_open_door = sound play for open door, OPTIONAL,
	sound_close_door = sound play for close door, OPTIONAL,
	only_placer_can_open = true/false,
	^ If true, only placer can open the door (locked for others)
}

#Trapdoor definition
----------------
{
	tile_front = "doors_trapdoor.png",
	^ the texture for the front and back of the trapdoor
	tile_side: "doors_trapdoor_side.png",
	^ the tiles of the four side parts of the trapdoor
	sound_open = sound to play when opening the trapdoor, OPTIONAL,
	sound_close = sound to play when closing the trapdoor, OPTIONAL,
	-> You can add any other node definition properties for minetest.register_node,
	   such as wield_image, inventory_image, sounds, groups, description, ...
	   Only node_box, selection_box, tiles, drop, drawtype, paramtype, paramtype2, on_rightclick
	   will be overwritten by the trapdoor registration function
}

Farming API
-----------
The farming API allows you to easily register plants and hoes.

farming.register_hoe(name, hoe definition)
 -> Register a new hoe, see [#hoe definition]

farming.register_plant(name, Plant definition)
 -> Register a new growing plant, see [#Plant definition]

#Hoe Definition
---------------
{
	description = "",	-- Description for tooltip
	inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",	-- Image to be used as wield- and inventory image
	max_uses = 30,	-- Uses until destroyed
	recipe = {	-- Craft recipe
		{"air", "air", "air"},
		{"", "group:stick"},
		{"", "group:stick"},
	}
}

#Plant definition
-----------------
{
	description = "",	-- Description of seed item
	inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",	-- Image to be used as seed's wield- and inventory image
	steps = 8,	-- How many steps the plant has to grow, until it can be harvested
	^ Always provide a plant texture for ech step, format: modname_plantname_i.png (i = stepnumber)
	minlight = 13, -- Minimum light to grow
	maxlight = default.LIGHT_MAX -- Maximum light to grow
}

Stairs API
----------
The stairs API lets you register stairs and slabs and ensures that they are registered the same way as those
delivered with minetest_game, to keep them compatible with other mods.

stairs.register_stair(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds)
 -> Registers a stair.
 -> subname: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_subname"
 -> recipeitem: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble"
 -> groups: see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 -> images: see [Tile definition]
 -> description: used for the description field in the stair's definition
 -> sounds: see [#Default sounds]

stairs.register_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds)
 -> Registers a slabs
 -> subname: Basically the material name (e.g. cobble) used for the stair name. Nodename pattern: "stairs:stair_subname"
 -> recipeitem: Item used in the craft recipe, e.g. "default:cobble"
 -> groups: see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
 -> images: see [Tile definition]
 -> description: used for the description field in the stair's definition
 -> sounds: see [#Default sounds]

stairs.register_stair_and_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, desc_stair, desc_slab, sounds)
 -> A wrapper for stairs.register_stair and stairs.register_slab
 -> Uses almost the same arguments as stairs.register_stair
 -> desc_stair: Description for stair node
 -> desc_slab: Description for slab node

Xpanes API
----------
Creates panes that automatically connect to each other

xpanes.register_pane(subname, def)
 -> subname: used for nodename. Result: "xpanes:subname" and "xpanes:subname_{2..15}"
 -> def: See [#Pane definition]

#Pane definition
----------------
{
	textures = {"texture_Bottom_top", "texture_left_right", "texture_front_back"},
	^ More tiles aren't supported
	groups = {group = rating},
	^ Uses the known node groups, see [Known damage and digging time defining groups]
	sounds = SoundSpec,
	^ See [#Default sounds]
	recipe = {{"","","","","","","","",""}},
	^ Recipe field only
}

Raillike definitions
--------------------
The following nodes use the group `connect_to_raillike` and will only connect to
raillike nodes within this group and the same group value:

| Node type		| Group value
+-----------------------+------------
| default:rail		| 2

This is an overview of currently used groups:
| Group value	| Description
+---------------+------------
| 2		| Rails

Example:
If you want to add a new rail type and want it to connect with default:rail,
add `connect_to_raillike=2` into the `groups` table of your node.


Default sounds
--------------
Sounds inside the default table can be used within the sounds field of node definitions.

default.node_sound_defaults()
default.node_sound_stone_defaults()
default.node_sound_dirt_defaults()
default.node_sound_sand_defaults()
default.node_sound_wood_defaults()
default.node_sound_leaves_defaults()
default.node_sound_glass_defaults()

Default constants
-----------------
default.LIGHT_MAX
^ The maximum light level (see [Node definition] light_source)

Player API
----------
The player API can register player models and update the player's appearence

default.player_register_model(name, def)
^ Register a new model to be used by players.
 -> name: model filename such as "character.x", "foo.b3d", etc.
 -> def: See [#Model definition]

default.registered_player_models[name]
^ Get a model's definition
 -> see [#Model definition]

default.player_set_model(player, model_name)
^ Change a player's model
 -> player: PlayerRef
 -> model_name: model registered with player_register_model()

default.player_set_animation(player, anim_name [, speed])
^ Applies an animation to a player
 -> anim_name: name of the animation.
 -> speed: frames per second. If nil, default from the model is used

default.player_set_textures(player, textures)
^ Sets player textures
 -> player: PlayerRef
 -> textures: array of textures
 ^ If <textures> is nil, the default textures from the model def are used

default.player_get_animation(player)
^ Returns a table containing fields "model", "textures" and "animation".
^ Any of the fields of the returned table may be nil.
 -> player: PlayerRef

Model Definition
----------------
{
	animation_speed = 30, -- Default animation speed, in FPS.
	textures = {"character.png", }, -- Default array of textures.
	visual_size = {x=1, y=1,}, -- Used to scale the model.
	animations = {
		-- <anim_name> = { x=<start_frame>, y=<end_frame>, },
		foo = { x= 0, y=19, },
		bar = { x=20, y=39, },
		-- ...
	},
}

Leafdecay
---------
To enable leaf decay for a node, add it to the "leafdecay" group.

The rating of the group determines how far from a node in the group "tree"
the node can be without decaying.

If param2 of the node is ~= 0, the node will always be preserved. Thus, if
the player places a node of that kind, you will want to set param2=1 or so.

The function default.after_place_leaves can be set as after_place_node of a node
to set param2 to 1 if the player places the node (should not be used for nodes
that use param2 otherwise (e.g. facedir)).

If the node is in the leafdecay_drop group then it will always be dropped as an
item.

Dyes
----
To make recipes that will work with any dye ever made by anybody, define
them based on groups. You can select any group of groups, based on your need for
amount of colors.

#Color groups
-------------
Base color groups:
- basecolor_white
- basecolor_grey
- basecolor_black
- basecolor_red
- basecolor_yellow
- basecolor_green
- basecolor_cyan
- basecolor_blue
- basecolor_magenta

Extended color groups (* = equal to a base color):
* excolor_white
- excolor_lightgrey
* excolor_grey
- excolor_darkgrey
* excolor_black
* excolor_red
- excolor_orange
* excolor_yellow
- excolor_lime
* excolor_green
- excolor_aqua
* excolor_cyan
- excolor_sky_blue
* excolor_blue
- excolor_violet
* excolor_magenta
- excolor_red_violet

The whole unifieddyes palette as groups:
- unicolor_<excolor>
For the following, no white/grey/black is allowed:
- unicolor_medium_<excolor>
- unicolor_dark_<excolor>
- unicolor_light_<excolor>
- unicolor_<excolor>_s50
- unicolor_medium_<excolor>_s50
- unicolor_dark_<excolor>_s50

Example of one shapeless recipe using a color group:
minetest.register_craft({
	type = "shapeless",
	output = '<mod>:item_yellow',
	recipe = {'<mod>:item_no_color', 'group:basecolor_yellow'},
})

#Color lists
------------
dye.basecolors
^ Array containing the names of available base colors

dye.excolors
^ Array containing the names of the available extended colors

Trees
-----
default.grow_tree(pos, is_apple_tree)
^ Grows a tree or apple tree at pos

default.grow_jungle_tree(pos)
^ Grows a jungletree at pos

default.grow_pine_tree(pos)
^ Grows a pinetree at pos
