Minetest Game [minetest_game]
=============================
~ The main game for the Minetest Engine ~


To use this game with Minetest, insert this repository as
  /games/minetest_game
in the Minetest Engine.

The Minetest Engine can be found in:
  https://github.com/minetest/minetest/

Compatibility
--------------
Minetest Game @ github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of Minetest Engine.

Additionally, when the Minetest Engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.10), Minetest Game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, Minetest Game is packaged (as minetest_game) and made available in
  http://minetest.net/download
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
