2012-07-26: Added a smelting step for recycling crafted items back into raw 
materials. 2 Glass bottles/cups -> 1 "glass fragments" -> smelt into normal 
glass block.  1 Steel bottle -> smelt to 1 steel ingot.

2012-07-26: Better bottle texture.  Note that it is blended against the 50% 
grey fields in the inventory display, so it will show artifacts if you try to 
wield it.  Don't do that. :-)
