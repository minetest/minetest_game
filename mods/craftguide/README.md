#### `craftguide` is the most comprehensive crafting guide on Minetest.
#### Consult the [Minetest Wiki](http://wiki.minetest.net/Crafting_guide) for more details.

This crafting guide is a blue book named *"Crafting Guide"* or a wooden sign.

This crafting guide features a **progressive mode**.
The progressive mode is a Terraria-like system that shows recipes you can craft
from items you ever had in your inventory. To enable it: `craftguide_progressive_mode = true` in `minetest.conf`.

`craftguide` is also integrated in `sfinv` (Minetest Game inventory). To enable it:
`craftguide_sfinv_only = true` in `minetest.conf`.

Use the command `/craft` to show the recipe(s) of the pointed node.

For developers, `craftguide` also has a [modding API](https://github.com/minetest-mods/craftguide/blob/master/API.md).
