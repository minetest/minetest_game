#### `craftguide` is the most comprehensive crafting guide on Minetest. ####
#### Consult the [Minetest Wiki](http://wiki.minetest.net/Crafting_guide) for more details. ####

#### This crafting guide is usable with a blue book named *"Crafting Guide"* ####

#### This crafting guide features two modes : Standard and Progressive. ####
The Progressive mode is a Terraria-like system that only shows recipes you can craft from items in inventory.
The progressive mode can be enabled with `craftguide_progressive_mode = true` in `minetest.conf`.

`craftguide` is also integrated in `sfinv` (Minetest Game inventory) when you enable it with
`craftguide_sfinv_only = true` in `minetest.conf`.
