Carts (formerly boost_cart)
==========================

Carts, based almost entirely on the mod boost_cart [1], which
itself is based on (and fully compatible with) the carts mod [2].

The model was originally designed by stujones11 [3] (CC-0).

Cart textures are based on original work from PixelBOX (WTFPL).
