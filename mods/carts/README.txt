Carts (formerly boost_cart)
==========================

Cleaned up for merge based almost entirely on SmallJoker's boost_cart
mod (github.com/smalljoker/boost_cart).

That in turn was based on (and fully compatible with) the mod "carts"
by PilzAdam

The model was redone, but based on github.com/stujones11/railcart, CC-0

Cart Textures are based on original work from PixelBOX (WTFPL).


Features
----------
- A fast cart for your railway or roller coaster (up to 10 m/s!)
- Boost and brake rails
- Rail junction switching with the 'right-left' walking keys
- Handbrake with the 'back' key
